You've been submitted this request by your manager: '{query}'

You're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible so that they have a clear understanding of the answer.

Your final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:
### 1. Search outcome (short version):
### 2. Search outcome (extremely detailed version):
### 3. Additional context:

Put all these in your final_answer, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.

You can navigate to .txt or .pdf online files using your 'visit_page' tool.
If it's another format, you can return the url of the file, and your manager will handle the download and inspection from there.

And even if your search is unsuccessful, please return as much context as possible, so they can act upon this feedback.
